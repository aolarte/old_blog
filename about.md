# About The Java Process

I started this blog with the intention of sharing some of my experiences in relation with programming. The more I have advanced in my career, the more I realized that few problems are truly unique, and that there are solutions out there to be found. It is my goal that the information contained here will help people facing similar problems.

During my career I've had the opportunity to tackle a multitude of challenges, related to complex enterprise integration, web application scalability, and complex data processing.

Last Saturday I passed the 1Z0-807 test, and I wanted to share some of my experience, specially since there seems to be little information about this test (compared to other Java certification tests at least).  You can also take a look at my study notes. &nbsp;You can see the my <a href="http://codemethod.blogspot.com/2014/09/passing-java-ee-6-enterprise-architect.html">notes for part 2 &amp; 3 here</a>.<br /><br />My total time to prepare was around 6 weeks.  It was a slow time at the office, so I think I was doing around 15-20 hours of reading / studying per week.<br /><br />Going into the studying phase I felt I was very weak in the EJB and JSF parts of the material, since it's not something that I actively use at work, while on the other technologies I felt I had a moderate to strong grasp on the material. <br /><br />I think 6 weeks was more than enough time to prepare if you have a background working with database driven Java web applications (even if not using the full Java EE stack as in my case). &nbsp;Your pace may vary, and honestly I signed up for the test before I had started studying, so the time constraint was my motivation.<br /><br />Books that I read to prepare for this test:<br /><br /><ul><li>"The Java EE 6 Tutorial" by Eric Jendrock et al. (you can get it <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/">here</a>)&nbsp;</li><li>"Real World Java EE Pattern" by Adam Bien (the second edition)&nbsp;</li><li>"Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for Java EE Study Guid" by Mark Cade and Humphrey Sheil&nbsp;</li><li>"Bitter Java"  and "Bitter EJB" by Bruce Tate&nbsp;</li><li>"SOA in Practice" by Nicolai Josuttis</li></ul>&nbsp;Books that I had read in the past that helped:<br /><br /><ul><li>"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" Erich Gamma,Richard Helm,Ralph Johnson,John Vlissides&nbsp;</li><li>"Enterprise Integration Patterns" by Gregor Hohpe&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br /></div>The biggest issue I had was the lack of a proper study guide for this test. &nbsp;The study guides I found were for the previous version of the test, based on Java EE 5, however most of the material is relevant. &nbsp;I found the Java EE 6 tutorial very useful to make sure I figured what were the gaps that I needed to fill. &nbsp;An specific guide for this test is supposed to be available very soon, so you might have better luck than I did. &nbsp;If and when it becomes available, by all means read it to guide yourself.<br /><br />In general I recommend getting through the material as described by the outline once, and then practicing and practicing some more. &nbsp;Get as many practice questions as you can. &nbsp;Some of those questions have subjective answers, but the more you practice the better chance you will have. Currently the only test simulator is from <a href="http://www.epractizelabs.com/">EPracticeLabs</a>, and while not awesome I think is more than enough to make it through.<br /><br />Relevant things that I found are not directly mentioned in the outline but are significant in the exam:<br /><br /><ul><li>Design patterns and anti-patterns (covered by the books listed above)</li><li>Security (specially risks and how to mitigate them)</li><li>When to use a technology. For example when to use EJB or just a web container. &nbsp;When to use DAOs, JDBC, or JPA. &nbsp;When to use durable subscribers in JMS. &nbsp;For this I would recommend you practice until you can detect the hints that the give in the questions regarding portability, scalability, etc.</li></ul>Regarding the exam itself I can point out:<br /><br /><ul><li>The exam was what I expected based on the practice questions I had seen. No surprise here.</li><li>There were many scenario questions with incomplete information. &nbsp;So it get's down to eliminating obvious wrong answers and then some luck picking from what's left.</li><li>Only multiple choice questions (pick one, or pick X). &nbsp;No drag and drop or anything like that.</li><li>Time is plentiful. &nbsp;The give you 150 minutes (two and a half hours). &nbsp;I'm fast at taking tests, but it took me thirty minutes to do my first pass, and probably ten minutes to review.</li><li>Some questions can get ambiguous if you over think them. &nbsp;For example, one-tier is a mainframe application, two-tier is thick client, three tier is web based application. &nbsp;Don't over think about a contrived three tier application with thick clients talking and sharing business logic with EJBs unless specifically told so on the questions.</li><li>Finally, they didn't give me result right away. &nbsp;They said I would get an email in 30 minutes with the result, but it arrived in a matter of five minutes or so after finishing the test. &nbsp;I haven't taken an Oracle test in more than 3 years, but I don't remember this being the case. &nbsp;</li></ul><br /><br /><div><div>You can take a look my study notes below. &nbsp;They do borrow material from some Java EE 5 notes that are floating around in the internet:</div><div><ul><li>http://java.boot.by/scea5-guide/</li><li>http://rieck.dyndns.org/architecture/scea5.html</li></ul><div><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div><iframe height="480" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wRpcFyLH309H_W1jFxTN-YOd7szCe4yilXtPuS9jKs/pub?embedded=true" width="640"></iframe> <br /><br />Here's the direct link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wRpcFyLH309H_W1jFxTN-YOd7szCe4yilXtPuS9jKs/pub">document</a>.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to add a comment and I'll try to help you.<br /><br />You can now see the my&nbsp;<a href="http://codemethod.blogspot.com/2014/09/passing-java-ee-6-enterprise-architect.html">notes for part 2 &amp; 3 here</a>.

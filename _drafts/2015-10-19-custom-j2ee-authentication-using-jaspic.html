The security model of J2EE applications can appear confusing at first sight. There is a disconnect between security declarations, and the authentication. &nbsp;Your application can declare what parts of your application are secured, using a variety of methods, such &nbsp;as annotations( @DeclareRoles, @RolesAllowed ), deployment descriptors (inside the web.xml), or even programmatically. &nbsp;The authentication part, however, is handled by the J2EE container (Glassfish, Weblogic, JBoss, etc). &nbsp;In some scenarios this makes sense, for example if you have a J2EE application that you sell to different companies. &nbsp;In such a case the J2EE model will enable to the App Server administrator to configure the authentication method that makes sense for his or her particular company. &nbsp;This method could be a JDBC connection to a user table, LDAP look up to company wide directory service, or even a local user database using a plain file. <br /><br />The solution for this problem is JASPIC (Java Authentication SPI for Containers), formalized by&nbsp;JSR-196.
